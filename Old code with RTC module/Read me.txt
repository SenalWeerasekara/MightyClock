Note: This Code is Deprecated and No Longer Maintained

This code was originally written for interfacing with an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module such as the DS3231. The module was intended to manage timekeeping and store configuration data.

However, due to hardware issues with the specific RTC module used, the decision has been made to discontinue support for this implementation. Instead, the ESP8266's built-in Wi-Fi capability will be used to fetch accurate time from internet-based NTP servers.

Reasons for the Switch

Advantages of RTC Modules:
Operates independently without internet connectivity
Simplified time setting and configuration

Advantages of Wi-Fi-Based Timekeeping:
Lower cost (no need for an external RTC module)
Eliminates the need for battery replacements
Automatically adjusts for daylight saving time and time zones

For better reliability and ease of maintenance, please refer to the updated version of the code that utilizes Wi-Fi for time synchronization.
